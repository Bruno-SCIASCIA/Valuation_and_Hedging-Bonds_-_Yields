# Valuation & Hedging – Bonds & Yields

A concise Jupyter Notebook developed for my Master’s program that walks through the valuation of government bonds, construction of spot & forward yield curves, and basic interest-rate-risk hedging.

## Key Topics
- Euro-area yield-curve data ingestion (ECB)
- Spot & forward rate bootstrapping
- Bond pricing via spot and forward rates
- Yield-to-maturity, DV01, duration & convexity
- Hedging a bond position using matched-DV01 and matched-duration strategies
- Clean vs. dirty price calculations
